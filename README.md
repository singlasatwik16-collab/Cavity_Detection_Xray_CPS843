🦷 Caries

🦷 Deep Caries

It uses a Roboflow YOLOv8 model (Dentex v2) and a fully custom-built Flask backend + HTML/JS front-end interface.
The system provides:

✔ Real-time cavity detection
✔ Bounding-box visualization
✔ Severity scoring (High / Medium / Low)
✔ A dedicated Cavity Viewer with HD sharpening
✔ A full-screen, futuristic UI with video background
✔ Local persistence to view cavities individually

This project demonstrates computer vision, image processing, UI/UX, backend integration, and applied machine learning.

🚀 Features
🔍 1. AI Detection

Uses Roboflow Dentex v2 model

Detects only:

caries

deep caries

Confidence threshold-based severity classification

JSON output for bounding boxes, confidence, labels

🖥 2. Beautiful Web Interface

Video background

Neon-themed medical UI

Animated transitions

Clear upload → analyze → results workflow

🖼 3. Results Summary

Total cavities

Count by severity

Average confidence

Highest confidence

Risk level (Low / Moderate / High)

🔎 4. Cavity Viewer (HD)

Each cavity can be viewed individually:

High-resolution crop

Automatic upscaling

Sharpening using convolution kernel

Improved visibility for analysis

Navigation between cavities

Bounding box overlay

💾 5. Local Storage Persistence

When navigating between pages:

Image

Detected cavities

Selected cavity

are preserved until user resets.

🧪 How Detection Works
1️⃣ User uploads dental X-ray
2️⃣ Flask sends image → Roboflow API
ROBOFLOW_URL = f"https://detect.roboflow.com/{PROJECT_ID}/{MODEL_VERSION}?api_key={ROBOFLOW_API_KEY}"

3️⃣ Model returns:

Bounding boxes

Class (caries / deep caries)

Confidence

4️⃣ We apply severity rules:
if prob >= 0.75: severity = "High"
elif prob >= 0.50: severity = "Medium"
else: severity = "Low"

5️⃣ Frontend draws boxes + labels on canvas
6️⃣ Cavity Viewer extracts and sharpens the crop

Using:

3× upscaling

Sharpening convolution kernel

Contrast boost

📜 Academic Note

This project was developed as part of CPS843 – Introduction to Computer Vision at TMU.
It demonstrates:

Image pre-processing

Bounding box visualization

AI model integration

Convolution-based sharpening

Web UI development
📚 References

This project builds upon publicly available research, datasets, and tools that contributed to the development of the cavity-detection system.

1. Dentex Dataset (Roboflow Universe)

The AI model used for detecting caries and deep caries is based on the publicly accessible Dentex dataset:
👉 https://universe.roboflow.com/dentex/dentex-3xe7e

This dataset provides annotated dental X-ray images used for training and evaluation of object detection models on dental cavities.

2. DentalXrayAI – YOLOv8 Training Reference

The cavity detection workflow, training pipeline structure, preprocessing ideas, and model integration approaches were partially inspired by:
👉 https://github.com/NoahOksuz/DentalXrayAI

This repository explores YOLO-based cavity detection on dental X-rays and contributed to architectural inspiration for this project.

3. Roboflow Inference API

The real-time detection in this project uses the Roboflow Hosted Inference API:
👉 https://roboflow.com

This API provides YOLOv8 inference endpoints that deliver bounding boxes, class predictions, and confidence scores.

4. TMU – CPS843 Course Material

General computer vision concepts used here (image processing, canvas rendering, convolution sharpening) are based on the topics and principles taught in CPS843 at Toronto Metropolitan University.
